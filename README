vanitygen-py

This is a simple implementation on a vanity address generator for bitcoin
addresses. Performance is of course not in par with the original vanitygen but
it is easy to understand and modify to your needs. If this has been useful,
please contribute to the development by sending me a pull request. I will
happily review it and merge.
